# WebServer
A simple HTTP web server in java




This demonstration highlights the creation of a multithreaded web server that delivers random weather information for four regions. To begin, run the Java application (server). Then, using a web browser such as Opera, Firefox, or Chrome, access the server by navigating to "http://localhost:4321/Joburg.html" on your local machine.
Different pages can be requested by the client
* localhost:4321/Joburg should serves the Joburg.html file to the client.
* localhost:4321/Durban should serves the Durban.html file to the client.
* localhost:4321/Cape should serves the CapeWithImage.html file to the client.
* localhost:4321/Africa.jpg should serves the Africa.jpg file to the client.
